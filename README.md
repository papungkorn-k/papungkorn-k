Hi there! My name is Papungkorn Kitcharoenkarnkul. I go by "Kob".

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the [Economics Department](https://www.econ.utah.edu/) at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/).

I am interested in applied microeconomics research, with a specific focus on education, labor, and health economics. I use this space to explore and experiment with my personal projects. If you plan to utilize any of the resources here, please do so with care!

Cheers,
